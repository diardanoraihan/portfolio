      <description>Designed experiments to evaluate 20+ deep learning models on 5 text classification datasets in Python and TensorFlow. Performed different text cleaning methods to fit the Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Word Embedding (WE) text representation. Engineered features by using different BoW scoring methods and WE modes (random, static pre-trained, and dynamic pre-trained). Optimized the feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, and ensemble-based neural networks to achieve the best model. Attained the best average accuracy by 90% using an ensemble-based model and temporal convolutional network, competing with the state-of-the-art benchmark models.</description>

      <description>Built a k-means clustering model in Python and Scikit-Learn to find the best location for starting a coffe shop business in Toronto city. Scrapped over 100 Toronto postal codes and 10 boroughs from Wikipedia using Python and Beautiful Soup; transformed it into a Pandas dataframe. Defined neighborhoods based on their postal codes and retrieved the coordinate (latitude and longitude) for each using Geocoder module. Analyzed the pedestrian and vehicle volumes from the Toronto Open Data; visualized it using Folium, leading to 139 lively / busiest roads.</description>

      <description>Led a 3-member team to build time series forecasting models for energy traders in 4 weeks boot camp using neural networks in Smojo. Engineered the features by using DIFF window, combined with momentum, force, and statistical attributes to help the model perform better prediction. Optimized the difference neural networks with input scaling subnet, dropout layer, and L2 regularization; achieved MAE/MSE of 0.5/0.3 using test loss while having no lag. Deployed the model and performed CI/CD using Autocaffe Labs; maximized revenue over 1-week trading by producing a net profit of 8.</description>
